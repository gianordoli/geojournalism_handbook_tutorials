# Geojournalism Handbook Tutorials
 
This series of tutorials was originally produced for the [Geojournalism
Handbook](http://geojournalism.org/).

The [Geojournalism
Handbook](http://geojournalism.org/) is part of the portfolio of the
[Environmental News Lab (Ecolab)](http://www.oeco.org.br/), a multidisciplinary team hosted at
Brazilian non profit news agency [O ECO](http://ecolab.oeco.org.br/) working to create useful
applications for environmental coverage. The online toolkit was created
in partnership with ICFJ, Internewsâ€™ [Earth Journalism Network](http://earthjournalism.net/) and the
[Flag It! Project](http://ecolab.oeco.org.br/projects/flagit/). It will be a resource for Flag It! participants in
Brazil, Nigeria, the Philippines and Romania.

**1. Deforestation diagram with Adobe Illustrator**

In this tutorial we will learn how to make a column chart using data in a table and how to customize it with some icons.

**2. Visualizing data with Processing**

In this tutorial we will learn how to load data from an external file and we will create a graph with a population area x for the 10 most populous cities in the world.

**3. Pesticides in Brazil**

I am going to introduce the dynamic mode in Processing and program a simple interaction. We will draw a basic bar chart that will serve as a basis for other forms you might explore, such as line, column, area etc.
Also, we will use for the first time an important programming concept: the conditional statement.

**4. Garbage Collection in Manhattan**
We will continue to explore interactions in Processing. We will also see some new drawing functions and use it to create a line graph and an area graph. And I will show some functions that make drawing multiple charts on a canvas easier.
